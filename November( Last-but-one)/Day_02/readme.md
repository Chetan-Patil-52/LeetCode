Intuition
To determine if a sentence is circular, we need to ensure that the last letter of each word matches the first letter of the following word, with the sentence beginning and ending on the same letter.

Approach
Check if the first and last characters of the sentence are the same.
Traverse the sentence. When encountering a space, verify that the last letter of the current word matches the first letter of the next word.
If all checks pass, the sentence is circular.

Complexity
Time complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the sentence, as we traverse the sentence once.
Space complexity: 

O(1), since no extra space is used apart from a few variables.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCircularSentence(string sentence) {
        // Get the length of the sentence
        int n = sentence.size();

        // First check : Compare first and last character of sentence
        // For circular sentence, they must match
        if(sentence[0] != sentence[n-1]) return false;

        // Iterate through the sentence, starting from index 1 to n-2
        // We don't need to check first and last characters again 
        for(int  i=1;i< n-1;i++){
            // When we find a space character
            if(sentence[i] == ' '){
                // Check if the character before space (last char of current word)
                // Check if the character after space (first char of next word)
                if(sentence[i-1] != sentence[i+1]) return false;
            }
        }

        // If we made it through all checks, the sentence is circular
        return true;
    }
};
```
