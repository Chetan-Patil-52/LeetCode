## TLE after using BruteForce

### Explanation
The brute force approach results in Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) due to its inefficiency in handling large inputs. Below is an example that illustrates this issue:

## Using Approach - 2

### Explanation
By using a more efficient algorithm, Approach 2 significantly reduces the computational time and avoids TLE. The optimized solution leverages better data structures and algorithms to solve the problem effectively.
